# Question 1: Write a Python program that takes two numbers as input from the user and performs the following operations:
# Addition
# Subtraction
# Multiplication
# Division
# Modulus
# Display the results for each operation.
# Input_1stnumber=int(input("Enter the First number :"))
# Input_2ndnumber=int(input("Enter the Second number :"))
# x=Input_1stnumber
# y=Input_2ndnumber
# Addition=x+y
# Subtraction=x-y
# Multiplication=x*y
# Division=x/y
# Modulus=x%y
#
# print("Addition of Two Input :",Addition)
# print("Addition of Two Input :",Subtraction)
# print("Addition of Two Input :",Multiplication)
# print("Addition of Two Input :",Division)
# print("Addition of Two Input :",Modulus)

# Question 2: Write a Python program that checks whether a given number is even or odd using the modulus operator.
# a=int(input("Enter the First number: "))
# b=int(input("Enter the Second number: "))
# if(a%b==0):
#     print("given number is even")
# else:
#     print("given number is odd")

# Question 3: Write a Python program that takes a number as input from the user and checks if it is positive, negative, or zero
# a=int(input("Enter the First number: "))
# if(a==0):
#     print("input is zero")
# elif(a<0):
#     print("input is negative")
# else:
#     print("input is positive")

# Question 4: Write a Python program that calculates the grade of a student based on the marks entered by the user. The grading scale is as follows:
#
# 90 and above: A
# 80 - 89: B
# 70 - 79: C
# 60 - 69: D
# Below 60: F
# grade_student=float(input("Please enter student marks:"))
# if grade_student >= 90:
#         print("Student grade is A")
# elif grade_student >=80:
#         print("Student grade is B")
# elif grade_student >= 70:
#         print("Student grade is C")
# elif grade_student >= 60:
#         print("Student grade is D")
# else:
#         print("Student grade is F")




# Question 5: Write a Python program to create a text file called sample.txt and write the sentence "Hello, this is a sample file." to the file. Then, read and display the content from the file.

# Creating and writing to sample.txt
# with open("sample.txt", "w") as file:
#     file.write("Hello, this is a sample file.")
#
# # Reading and displaying the content
# with open("sample.txt", "r") as file:
#     content = file.read()
#     print("File Content:", content)


# Question 7: Write a Python program to print the numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop.

# Python program to print numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop
# for number in range(1, 11):
#     print(number)

#8 Python program to display the multiplication table of a number entered by the user

# Get the number from the user
# number = int(input("Enter a number to display its multiplication table: "))
# for i in range(1, 11):
#     print(number, "X", i ,"=" ,number * i)

# Question 6: Write a Python program that reads a text file called data.txt and counts the number of words in the file.
file=open("data.txt","r")
count=0
for words in file:
    words = words.split(" ")
    count+= len(words)
file.close()
print("the number of words in the file :",count)
